# Networking Madness
Looking into different ways to assign networks and deal with things. Here is what I have been coming up with.

## Proxy
We can have the proxy run on an externally available network then also have it connect to the internal network. Might need to have that network have a firewall of its own to enusre connections can't leave. (Leave that as a stretch goal for now).

## Subnets
Not sure about just making one massive subnet, it would make life easier if I can make multiple subnets which can connect with each other. Going to look into this more.
