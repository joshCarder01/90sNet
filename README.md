# 90sNet
90s Net recreates the feel of network and systems from the University of Cincinnati West main campus in the 1990s, but in a completely virtual environment for use in live fire cyber exercises. User and Admins can interact with and manage systems appropriately, as if it were a true network. This should be an effective training ground for cyber exercises in a familiar environment for students.
