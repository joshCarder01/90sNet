## Competitors
As a naive competitor, I want to have traffic which comes from 90s net appear to be normal traffic for a university, that way I can capture traffic and view it.

As an attacker, I want machines to be vulnerable to cyber attacks which are somewhat common, my skill will then be tested as I move through the network.

As a competitor, I want my own access of 90s net to remain secure, that way my own system does not become compromised from traffic on the network.

## Organizers
As a 90s net host, I want the network to be resiliant to denial of service and other attacks which may down the network, that way the network can automate recovery and I do not have to manage the resources.

As a 90s net scorer, I want the network to keep track of competitors access of machines so that the scoring system will keep track of the scores without human intervention.

As a 90s net challenge developer, I want a simple interface which allows me to build new machines easily, that way the creation of new configurations of 90s net is simple.
