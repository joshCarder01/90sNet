This senior design project, called "90s Net" aims to recreate the network and systems of the University of Cincinnati West main campus in the 1990s in a completely virtual environment.
Users should be able to connect to this network and interact with it as if it were a true network
Admins should be able to control and view aspects of the network using common network tools.
An interface should be able to create network views and run automation's triggered by user actions all from an external perspective.
In total, this network should be an effective training ground for basic cyber exercises in a (hopefully) non-derived and familiar environment for students.

During my time in undergrad I have taken several classes that involve many aspects of my project.
My first year, I took Engineering Design Thinking 1 (ENED 1100) where I lead projects and helped my group through several programming challenges. 
During the Fall of my fourth year in undergrad, I took Computer Networks (CS-4065) which provided foundational knowledge of basic networking.
This year, I am taking Computer Networking (CS-5143) and Cyber Defense Overview (CS-5155).
These will both extend my networking knowledge for infrastructure purposes, and give a cyber security lens that will be taken in account when designing specific aspects of the project.
I believe the skills and experiences from these courses will serve me well in both technical and administrative aspects of this project.

During my time in undergrad I worked five co op rotations with Northrop Grumman where I held the title of "cyber security co op". 
During my time, I worked various projects with heavy aspects of networking, which should serve me well in this project.
I also was able to lead projects of my own during my time.
I talked to fellow engineers, gathered input, created roadmaps, and executed "hands on keyboard" development for two expansive projects over the course of seven months.
When these projects hit major milestones I gave substantive presentations on functionality at both a technical level and mile high view, and was commended for my ability to work at both levels.
I believe these skills and experiences will serve me well in both technical and administrative aspects of this project.

My motivation for starting this project comes from a merging of two passions, that of campus history and decisions taken during its evolution, and computer networking and security.
Looking back thirty years, west main campus looked a good deal different.
Many of the defining structures on campus, like the engineering research center, the campus rec center complex, and university pavilion hadn't been built yet.
Main street was once an actual street, lined with parking lots and even a coal power plant right in the middle of campus.
I have found great satisfaction in learning and independently researching these changes to campus over time, even before the idea for this project had formed.
I am greatly motivated to direct my attention now from historical architecture on campus, to campus operations, and to see how things were different thirty years ago and how they compare to now.

Our preliminary approach to this project include several steps.
First we will interview faculty from many departments about their knowledge of the campus network system from the time period.
Second, we would set scopes for multiple goal posts. 
At this point we do not know how many systems existed on the network at this time and how they interacted, only guesses. 
We will need to set realistic goals for size based on these points, as well as hardware we have available (Cloud computing, The Ohio Cyber Range, or a local server).
Third, we will need to implement these systems and network virtually, building in an interface that can be acted on.
Finally, as a stretch goal, we would like to build automated adversaries that would act like users on the network that act through this interface.
The expected result is a virtual network network that should be an effective training ground for basic cyber exercises in a (hopefully) non-derived and familiar environment for students.
We will know we have done a good job if we can meet our set scope in the time allotted.
