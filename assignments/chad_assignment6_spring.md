## Essay
In the senior design project, we took on quite a task of creating an environment which could host CTF competitions on a simulated network. I contributed to the backend, allowing for the orchestration of the whole system. My work in the backend API server allows for our system to be distributed across many systems. This allows for our project to have the capability of being ported to the cloud with ease. This also allows for us to support more data manipultation in the future which could be handled by the server. It is also built to validate data from the rest of the system which helps catch bugs from other parts of the project. In addition I made the Compose Generator, which enables easy configuration of our system with containers being set up to different locations around campus.
