# Project Constraints Essay
*Chad Lape and Joshua Hale*

## Outline

* Economic
    * Will be using existing resouces and the whole project would likely take up a lot of computing resources.
        * Would need project to be able scalable for different amounts of resources
    * Would not be something which could viably contain the entire resources of the UC network.
* Professional
* Ethical
    * Would the project be used as a testing ground for modern day viruses.
    * Making sure any network is relatively accurate to the 90s.
* Legal
    * Would not involve any constraints due to licensing.
    * More would be if there were any overbroad lawyers who really didn't like the premise of stuff.
* Maintainability
    * Project needs to be maintainable by those who didn't create the project.
    * Easy to learn and extend the project for different jobs.
* Security
    * Obvious concerns of a live fire environment, need to keep contestents safe while leaving a whole simulated environment.
    * Concerns for attacks on hardware and keeping a sandboxed and containerized environment.

## Actual stuff

### Economic
Constraints on the economics of the project would pertain to the hardware used and computing resources available. Our implementation will be made to run on a server we will already have access to with the permission of a student organization. The project would use preexisting implementations of scalable deployment such that it could be run on most hardware setups without much worry.

### Ethical
Some ethical constraints this project would have, largely are preventing this project from simply being a testing ground for modern day malware to attack. With this simulating a network from the 90s, this live fire environment would be rendered largely irrelevant for any modern attackers. This risk is acceptable however as most modern attackers would already have their own resources to test on, and would need a lot of information already to simulate a corporate or other victim network.

### Maintainability
This software would also be constrained by its usefullness to be maintined by others with little to no knowledge of its development. This software must be made to be easily extendable and able to be developed on to fit the needs of other projects which might rely on it. It must also be relatively easy to know given a basic knowledge of cloud computing and such so that maintainers would not be burdened with months of learning just this tool alone.

### Security
Of upmost importance is the security of contestents who connect to the live fire environemnt. Great care must be taken to ensure that connections from outside are safeguarded by any potential threat rampaging through the live fire environment. There can be security measures implemented through proxies which will help limit this threat to contestents.

# First Full Draft

There are a number of constraints this project is being prepared to meet, including those in the topics of economic, ethical, maintinence, and security constraints.

# Final Draft

The project will satisfy various constraints, including but not limited to economics, ethics, maintenance, and security. 
The economic constraints would center on the hardware used and computing resources available. Our implementation will run on a server maintained by a student organization. The project would use preexisting implementations of scalable deployment such that it runs on any hardware given to it.
The ethical constraints of this project center on this project becoming a testing ground for modern-day malware. With this simulating a network from the 90s, this live-fire environment would be irrelevant for any modern attackers. Any risk of this is minimal as a simulation of a corporate network would already require intimate knowledge of that network's inner workings.
This software's purpose would be constrained if it were esoteric to others. It must be easily extendable to fit the needs of other projects which rely on it. In addition, future project maintainers should be able to quickly understand its workings. It must also be relatively easy to know given a basic knowledge of cloud computing and such so that maintainers would not be burdened with months of learning just this tool alone.
The security of contestants is of utmost importance as connections to the live-fire environment will come into contact with malicious software. Implementation of proxies and networking rules can help mitigate the threat to contestants. We will conduct further research to safely sandbox the network from outside resources.
