# Milestones
1. Lock down network design (complete 10/31): Have a formal design written for the network structure within 90s net set.

2. Small scale network demonstration (10/31): Have one network spoke along with around a dozen devices virtualized and communicating. A user should be able to proxy into this network as well.

3. Network interaction demonstration (11/30): Have an automated system and admin abilities to interact with the network.

4. Network device template design lock (1/30): All devices on the virtual network will be derived from a handful of templates. This templates should be finished (operational single units).

5. Admin infrastructure demonstration (2/28): Infrastructure, systems, and programs used by admins to interact with.

6. Event scanning demonstration (2/28): Events that occur on the network should be logged to be seen by admins for dealt with by future automated systems.

7. Automated system dealing with events demonstration (3/31): A system that scores players based on actions taken in the network. Built off of event scanning and logging.
