Josh spent the fall semester focussed on research into historical and network systems, and prototype development for individual modules of the larger project. The research into historical systems provided a baseline understanding into university systems of the time which could later be built on. The prototype development was critical for understanding new technologies and minimizing the amount of back tracking and refactoring needed to ensure a viable product. Additionally, in the spring semester, Josh continued with prototype development, which lead to the creation of four critical modules, the front end, network monitor, network manager, and automated adversaries. Not only did these systems have to be functional by themselves but they had to communicate and rely on each other at runtime. This provided a longer than typical design, construction, and testing process. Josh also created tests for these systems to improve efficiency.

Chad spent the fall semester focussed on research into network and scalability systems, and prototype development for individual modules of the larger project. The research into these systems provided a baseline understanding for what technologies currently exist in the world and where we could innovate. The prototype development was critical for understanding new technologies and minimizing the amount of back tracking and refactoring needed to ensure a viable product. Additionally, in the spring semester, Chad continued with prototype development, which lead to the creation of three critical modules, the central server (including network management systems) and the network configuration tool. The central sever was the hub for all other module communications and had to be reliable, so tests were constructed to improve efficiency. Chad also created and configured the example challenges on the network used at the demonstration.
