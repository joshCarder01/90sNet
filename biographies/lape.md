# Co-op or other experience and responsibilities
## Cyber Software Engineer - Northrop Grumman
*5 Semesters*
* Created an embedded C debug logger which would not be compiled into the production environment to save space.
* Developed automated testing procedures based on manual test procedures which could ensure no regression of project goals occurred.
* Vulnerability analysis on target software to reach project milestones in accordance to customer requirements.
## Cyber@UC Competition Team Leader and Vice President
*3 Years*
* Teach newcomers how to complete cybersecurity challenges.
* Compete in CTFs and lead others in completing challenges.
* Interact with sponsors and host CTFs, creating challenges that vary in difficulty.
* Creating slides for general club meetings and for outreach events.
* Hosting executive meetings to help keep the club working towards its goals.
## 2022 NSA Codebreaker Challenge Completion
*1 Semester*
* One of roughly 150 nationwide to complete the challenge.
* Cryptanalysis of reverse engineered ransomware tool which enabled recovery of the targeted files.
* Development of scripts and tools to assist in exploitation of vulnerabilities.
* Forensics of network traffic to identify virus sent to a victim machine.
* Exploitation of GitHub hosted webserver to get source code and later administrator access through SQL injection.
* Forensics of SSH agent core dump to extract private keys
# Skills
* Programming: C++, C, Python, Go, Ruby
* Reverse Engineering, Cryptanalysis, Vulnerability Research, Exploitation Engineering
* Linux and Windows
# Areas of Interest
* Virtual Machines
* Embedded Software
* Reverse Engineering
* Exploit Creation Tools
# Types of Project Sought
* Virtual machine template partitioning system, essentially to make it so one root partition can support multiple virtual machines.
* GO Reverse Engineering tools, would find the type, function, and source information in the later parts of the GO file.
* Tools which randomize and obfuscate strings within a pre existing binary for CTFs. Potentially something which would do this during compile time, more to make it so it is more difficult to pull the flag compared to solving the challenge.
* Things which have interesting applications to hosting CTFs
* Other Reverse Engineering Tools
